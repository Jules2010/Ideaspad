# Background

Ideaspad was written between 2002 and 2007, initially I wrote it for myself. I wanted something where I could write and maintain project notes, where I could build up certain areas in more detail.

Later the term “Mind Mapping” became relevant, a researcher contacted me asking for some additional features to help with this feature.

Also I had sales from companies, even a 20 user license.

At the time my background was in Visual Basic 6, VB.Net seemed the obvious progression.

Although the idea of sharing an MS Access database isn't ideal, this does work with a small number of users. Ideaspad provides some simply locking to make sharing more reliable.


# How to build / edit the code

You’ll need Microsoft Visual Basic .Net 2003, you can download this as part of your MSDN benefits.

You will also probably need to use Windows 7 or earlier.

Perhaps in future I may upgrade this project if this becomes a popular request.

You’ll also need to install Microsoft Data Access Components 2.8.

I have included a Components folder which includes most of the required DLLs.

You’ll notice there are two project files for Ideaspad and a number of DLLs suffixed with Debug, these are added to one solution for easier debugging. (Why, well there needs to be separate solution to allow for obfuscating / strong name signing, which is used in the batch files.)

So the easiest way to compile the project is to open \CodeLibrary\SharewareProjs\IdeasPad\IdeasPadDebug.sln
