From here you can simply export all the data used in one template.

This feature will be especially useful to business users.<BR>
It enables you to move your data into another system.<BR>
You may have decided to build a basic system, overnight using Ideaspad, without the need for expensive system developers.<BR>
Then if your venture takes off, you can export and upgrade to a bigger dedicated system.
