The import and export wizards allow you to exchange your Ideaspad information between Information Base files and other people.

<BR><BR>

You can select what you want to export or import.

<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="gfx/export_wizard.png" border="0" height="299" width="374">

<BR><BR>

You may wonder why you would want to give your information to someone else.<BR>
Well Ideaspad is quite powerful, you can change it to suit the needs of a specific purpose or task.<BR>
Chances are that someone else may want a system just like yours.

<BR><BR>
<font color="#0000ff">
For example you could create your own order entry system or recipe system.
</font>

<BR><BR>

Once you have selected what you want to export from the screen just above, click next.

<br><br>

If you had selected that you wanted to export some topics, you would see the screen below.

<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="gfx/export_wizard_branch.png" border="0" height="299" width="374">
<BR><BR>

From here, you can select whether you want export all topics / branches or just one branch.

<BR><BR>

Once selected click next.

<BR><BR>

Again, if you had selected that you wanted to export template files or colour scheme files a selection screen would be shown.

<BR><BR>

Once selected click next.

<BR><BR>

At this point the wizard will look at the items you have chosen to export and will inform you if there are any problems.<BR>
For instance, you may have selected to export a certain branch and some bookmarks.<BR>
But if you have a bookmark for a topic that you haven't exported this will produce a problem.

<BR><BR>

Although, these are JUST warnings!

<br>

After all, it may be that you had deleted the topic and the bookmark is orphaned anyway.

<BR><BR>

Click export, you will be promoted to provide a filename, then the process will produce your export file.
