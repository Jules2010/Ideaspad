You can import text from your favourite Rich text editor (e.g. Wordpad, or RTF saved from MS Word) into Ideaspad.

<BR><BR>

Please take care not to import a big file.<BR>
The reason for this is that it will take longer to load a topic with a lot of information.<BR>
The nature of Ideaspad is that you can navigate through branches, loading large amounts of information will undoubtedly cause problems.

<BR><BR>

If in doubt load the RTF file into Wordpad and see how long it takes to load the information.
