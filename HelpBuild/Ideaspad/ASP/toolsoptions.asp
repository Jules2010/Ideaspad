There are some options you can change.

<br><br>

Such as :-<br>
Such as :-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Default fonts, for the tree and the rich text box.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- General, selects which topic is shown first.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Information base icons, you can use your own icons.  This feature is also available over a network with multi users customers. Ideapad picks up icons in alphabetical order. Therefore it is suggested that you use numbers to name your icons.  So if you had 5 of your own icons (1.gif, 2.gif, 3.gif, 4.gif, 5.gif), to add an new icon you'd name it 6.gif.  Take care with the sequence of these files as it will affect which icons are used.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sort order, this refers to the order in which branches / topics are displayed, see <a href="branchprops.html">branch properties</a> to change sequence number.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Spelling, allows you to add or change which dictionary you are using.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Templates, see below.

<BR><BR>

The Templates options allow you to specify whether new topics / branches are created as rich text (which is default) or by using a template.<BR>
This could be useful, if you are configuring Ideaspad for a specific purpose.

To change to using templates, select the Template radio button, then click the select button to choose a template.

<BR><BR>

Then you can also specify a colour scheme. <BR>
Colour schemes are available using Cascading Style Sheets CSS , please refer to information on the internet or at your local book shop for further information on CSS.

Once selected click Apply then OK.
